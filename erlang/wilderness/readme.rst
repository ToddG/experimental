Purpose
-----------------------

I'm experimenting with Erlang, but I'm finding that I forget things, unless I write them down. I'm sharing my experiences here, and especially the things that were difficult and frustrating. 

For example, in Episode-02_, I intentionally take the reader down several dead-ends as we try to noodle out how to create an erlang application. Along the way, I introduce some interesting utilities and features that will become more useful in later episodes. You see, even though I've read all 3 erlang books (multiple times), I still find the 'erlang' thing a little awkward. 

Hopefully, these simple posts will help others as much as they are helping me.
